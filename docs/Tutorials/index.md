# Tutorials
This sections contains hands-on tutorials for a novice developer to setup test environment that utilizes the localization class library.
These tutorials demonstrate bulk of the features, but not all of the features and not comprehensively. 

## Assemblies
There are four class libraries. They can all be imported from NuGet package management system.

*Lexical.Asset* contains feature for setting up localization assets, and feature for acquiring binary resources from assets.
Resources such as sounds, icons and other graphics. *Lexical.Asset.Abstractions* contains the abstractions.
The namespace is *Lexical.Asset*

The main library is *Lexical.Localization*. It contains the feature for handling *language strings*. 
*Lexical.Localization.Abstractions* contains the interfaces. 
Both use namespace *Lexical.Localization*.

Compability with Microsoft.Extensions's abstractions are held in namespaces *Lexical.Asset.Ms.Extensions* and *Lexical.Localization.Ms.Extensions*.
